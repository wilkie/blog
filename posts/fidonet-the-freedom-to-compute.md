***This is a [reposting](http://www.goto10.fr/fidonews/1986/fido311.nws)
of an editorial written in FidoNews published on March
17th, 1986 by Mike Guffey. FidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet distributed network which
was a network of dialup BBSes that could share information. It was the first wide network that
allowed the public to communicate globally for free.***

***As this was written in the mid 80s, there is a strong anti-soviet/communism
and pro-american viewpoint. At the time, FidoNet was young and mostly had an
American audience. FidoNet has been recently used in areas where internet
censorship is prevalent. Interestingly, one
[such use](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XFmXp0-KHA )
is within former-soviet
states along the border of Russia who actively resist Russian control.***

***The Freedom to Compute: The human right to use a computational model to derive
any result.***

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Professor [Loren  Graham](http://web.mit.edu/sts/people/graham.html)
of  M.I.T.  recently  wrote  an  article
entitled  *"The  Kremlin and the Computer"*.  He depicted life with
state controlled computing.  His observation that  George  Orwell
had  it  all backwards in *"1984"* is shrewd.  He noted that Orwell
thought technology would allow "Big Brother" to maintain control.
Who would have guessed the Soviet Union would turn the tables and
retain control  by  the  suppression  of  technology,  especially
computer technology?

If   America's   government  relied  on  keeping  the  population
uninformed to retain power and control, things would be different
today.  What if your government didn't permit computer access  to
large amounts of accurate data,  didn't permit free communication
between computer users?  What if your government would not  allow
widespread   use   of  personal  computers  for  fear  of  losing
"control"?  How long could your government hope to genuinely keep
pace in the information age?

These were questions Graham explored in his article.  He  painted
a  grim  picture of what might be called "retrograde technology".
He points out some democratic traditions indicating an edge  over
communist [and third world] nations:

* A  tradition  of  successful technology developed under private
ownership and control.

* Close relationships between creators,  buyers  and  sellers  of
technology

* A  tradition  of free access to and creation of massive amounts
of reliable information about most topics.

* Excellent communications facilities  necessary  for  access  to
diverse and far-flung data bases.

* A tradition of entrepreneurial and innovative freedom .

Graham   goes  on  to  say,

> So  far  the  pattern  [of  Soviet
> authorities] seems  to  be  to  require  that  all  computers  be
> institutionally  housed  and controlled.  But what [they] may not
> have realized is that they will pay a stiff price...  by severely
> limiting  the rapidity of the growth of the computer culture,  by
> hampering the spread of computer  literacy  among  young  people,
> ...by  watching the West become a true 'information society' they
> will be doomed to follow..."

Graham also calls the  Soviet  Union
"the  most  secretive  industrialized power in the world".  These
observations are based on  a  recent  visit  to  Moscow  and  his
background in the history of science.

There  is  no  known "hacker-culture" in the Soviet Union and its
youth is missing out on the experiences available to millions  of
American  schoolkids,  hobbyists  and  average  business computer
users.  Nor does the Soviet Union's educational system  emphasize
hands-on  experience  with high-technology hardware.  Even typing
is not widely taught.

Graham's article raises the question about how  long  the  Soviet
Union can retain a genuinely international status with a decaying
economy  that  can  neither heal itself with accurate information
nor give its children a legacy of competition in an  increasingly
computer-aided  world.  Surely a disturbing question for an aging
leadership.

So what about your most taken-for-granted freedom?  How important
is it to you?  What are you planning to do to protect it?  Unlike
the gun control or right-to-life issues,  the freedoms you  enjoy
in accessing as much (or as little) information as you desire are
seldom  regarded  as  burning  issues.  Are you to allowing it to
slip away as the communications giants gradually make  the  price
of information prohibitive?

In  earlier  times,  free  enterprise  aviation developed rapidly
because suffocating regulation had not yet  arrived  and  no  one
thought  to make air corridors into tollways.  Later,  after long
years of gradually instituted legislation,  many industry  giants
couldn't  survive  their  emancipation.  Today  our  situation is
reversed.  We have started out on overcrowded highways controlled
by one giant.  Let us hope the giant remains benevolent.  Let  us
hope  the  giant  doesn't team up with the federal bureaucracy to
act on our behalf without our consent.

Just where does one suggest a constitutional amendment?

***This article illustrates the notion that controlling computation
may be a means of controlling information. I find it intriguing
that this thought existed as early as 1986. This predates the
[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fraud_and_abuse_act)
which is overused against those attempting to spread information, and predates the attack on public
cryptography with the [Arms Export Control Act](http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/950403/archive_010975.htm).
It came before the public internet and the cloud infrastructure that has both opened
the door to greater public usage of infrastructure, yet also promoted heavily
privatized control over user content. Have we improved? Do these modern incidents
and even designs of software and networks reinforce a lack of freedom
to compute?***

***Is the freedom to compute, for instance the ability to use our devices
to generate and access any information, something we need to more aggressively
fight for?***

If you'd like more information about FidoNet, there is an entire episode
dedicated to the network you can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlXNXdf6Xh0)
from the great Jason Scott documentary, [BBS Documentary](http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/).
DVDs of the creative commons content are available on the website for the documentary.
Very much a recommended watch (this episode and the HPAC episode especially.)
