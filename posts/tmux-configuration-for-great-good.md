The tmux (terminal multiplexor) tool is a great way to manage the hellspawn of
computational evolution and TERMINFO hurdling that is the *modern* terminal. If
you spawn multiple terminals, or even multiple terminal tabs, to manage your
terminal space... stop that immediately.

I just want to jot down some quick configuration fu to set up a decent tmux environment.
We want one with 256 color support, a more than decent amount of scrollback, utf8, etc.

## .bash_profile

To have 256 colors, we need to set the TERM variable to xterm-256color by adding an
export to our bashrc. Put this line at the end:

    export TERM=xterm-256color

Alternatively, (if you don't want to do that for some reason) we can just alias the tmux command
to set that variable only for tmux:

    alias tmux='TERM=xterm-256color tmux'

Now, to support 256 colors **within** tmux, we add the following line to the end
of our bashrc:

    # for tmux: export 256color
    [ -n "$TMUX" ] && export TERM=screen-256color

## .tmux.conf

Throw whatever subset of these features you'd like into the .tmux.conf file in your
home folder. Create one if it doesn't exist.

### 256 Colors

    set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

### Scrollback History

    set -g history-limit 30000   # 30,000 lines of scrollback

### UTF8

    set -g utf8 on               # utf8

### Mouse

    setw -g mode-mouse on        # Mouse useful in copy-mode
    set  -g mouse-select-pane on # Mouse can select the current pane

### Vi-Style Commands

    setw -g mode-keys vi         # vi-style commands in copy-mode


### UI Color Scheme

While refering to the palette above, set each of these
values to something you find appealing but not distracting. Here
is an example using greens and grays you can add to your .tmux.conf:

    # statusbar colors
    set -g status-fg colour236
    set -g status-bg colour70
    
    # active window title on statusbar
    set-window-option -g window-status-current-fg colour192
    set-window-option -g window-status-current-bg default
    
    # inactive window title on statusbar
    set-window-option -g window-status-fg colour236
    set-window-option -g window-status-bg default
    
    # border around window
    set-window-option -g pane-border-fg colour236
    set-window-option -g pane-active-border-fg colour70

## Loading the configuration

You do not need to quit tmux to alter the configuration. Just detach and type

    tmux source ~/.tmux.conf

And then reattach:

    tmux attach

And you're all set.
