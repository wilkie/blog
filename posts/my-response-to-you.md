## People have tried to do this before

I'd hope so. we in the real world call this _related work_ or privately refer to it as _guidance_

## But X did this and it was really bad

true. we call that _inspiration_ and a big reason why we should still publish negative results.

## Nobody will use this

you mean _I won't use this_ and that's fine with me.

## But X already exists and people aren't going to switch.

showing that X isn't enough doesn't mean I have to destroy X. the contrary actually. I don't like monoliths so I think people might want two things.

## Performance will be slow

psychics don't exist. what is your definition of [performance](/posts/kaashoeks-law) anyway. oh its a bad one so that you can fake being a scientist while describing a hypothesis as though fact.

## X did it better

fine. they have a head start. you seem obsessed with _best_, which is fair because Pete Best was the best Beatle.

## But your design won't work for this particular situation

no shit. look at that, we both understand really fundamental design trade-offs. glad we can relate to one another so well.

## Don't you take government defense money?

all US-based computer scientists do because that's where all the money is. welcome to the national sciences. talk to your legislators about reforming science funding today! can't talk more about this... I have to go spend the little money I have on food and perpetual loan interest.

## I could do it better

shut up and do it.
