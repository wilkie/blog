***Warning:*** This post will contain comments posted publicly exactly as they were written. That is, without edit. They contain highly dismissive language and derogatory statements against women with an occasional slur. They also contain a frustratingly poor understanding of science and statistics.

------

I am a hypocrite. I typically tell you to not read the comments. However, this
time I want you to see them. These are comments one can find [here](www.businessinsider.com/being-a-woman-in-tech-2013-3?pundits_only=0&get_all_comments=1&no_reply_filter=0). This article is
a rather odd form of a republishing of a blog post written by a friend of mine. I know her
personally and I trust that her account of her own experiences is true.

Share my trust and read these comments for what they really are. Read between
the lines with me and see the culture that lies underneath.

I've chosen to simply republish the comments without attribution in the *order
they appear.* I'm not just picking the ones that look bad... I'm simply copy-and-pasting
them as they were posted. Just top-level comments, no replies. Here we go...

> Woman sounds like she's be happier in a different job.
> Believe it or not, men are pretty nasty and competitive to other men, too, not just to women, when there's a dollar or a promotion involved.
> I get it when women piss and moan about gender discrimination but there are all kinds of discrimination at work and women don't, in any way, have a monopoly on shabby treatment!
> Real life is sometimes a struggle and it's rarely fair; Grow up or get out.

&nbsp;

> you know what the typical guy would do, he would either suck it up and become better,quit or start his own company
> you know what the typical woman would do, she would bitch the first chance she gets...oh wait

&nbsp;

> WAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH

&nbsp;

> Oh spare me your agony! She chose to work in a male-dominated profession. Guys will be guys. Stop taking things so personally. Grow a thicker skin. Have you been touched improperly? Have you been stopped from advancing in your career? Has any male actually said anything to your face that was inappropriate? No....so...grow up!
> Believe me...if a guy had to work in a female dominated area....the table would be turned.
> I'm so SICK of these whining women!

&nbsp;

> Just great. Now we will need White Knight Democrats to the rescue passing laws that say women must not be allowed to "feel" being discriminated against at work.

&nbsp;

> In every day life and across all media we are constantly bombarded by many examples of women complaining about something. The female-as-victim mindset and the general penchant for complaint is biology based and nothing new.

&nbsp;

> If it's politically incorrect, it's true at least 90% of the time. This applies in all areas. Think about it...

&nbsp;

> Sounds like another man-hating, pug-fugly lesbian that finds something wrong with absolutely every aspect and facet of a man's existence, and bitches about it to no end. Doesn't this never ending bitching constitute "creation of a hostile workplace"? It would if roles were reversed.
> Uggch!

&nbsp;

> She may be very talented. But it is an undeniable fact that the number of women with high IQ is much than the number of men with high IQ. And when you veer into the very high end of the IQ scale, the number of women gets smaller and smaller.
> Just change Tech to Chess, and you'll see this. There are 1,312 chess grand masters in the world, but only 13 of them (!) are women. Indeed, there is a special grand master rank for women: WGM: Woman Grand Master, where men chivalrously do not compete, or they'll swamp all of it.
>
> Prof. Camille Benbow of Vanderbilt U did the (peer-reviewed) research, and found out that:
>
> At the 98% IQ level (Mensa level), the ratio of men to women is 3:2 (and that, btw, is also the ratio of men to women in Mensa groups worldwide).
>
> At the 99% level, it is 4:1
>
> 99.5% level, 7:1.
>
> 99.9% level, 11:1.
>
> Apparently at chess grand master level it is 100:1
> Please note-- it doesn't say women are dumber. The average IQ for men and women is the same.
> It only says that women are more homogeneous than men. There are more men idiots, and more men geniuses. More men midgets, and more men giants. More men criminals, etc.
> So that female techie can be as smart as Sophie Germain, Lady Ada Lovelace, and Amy Noether all rolled in one. But there are not many others like her.
> Again: the number of very smart women is not zero. It is just much, much lower than the number of super smart men. It is a fact. You want to argue? Complain to God, nature, or evolution. Your choice...

&nbsp;

> Obviously her problem is she is not "Leaning In" enough. "Every time I try to push to make things better, I am guaranteed a patronizing response from someone,"
> Maybe your ideas just aren't that good and they patronize you to try and AVOID hurting your feelings. And if I had a dollar for everytime a whiny woman complains about how men constantly mistreat them, I'd be more rich.

&nbsp;

> another victim... the sooner people stop acting like they're due something, the sooner they'll experience success and respect.

&nbsp;

> I have worked with a number of women in the software engineering field and from my perspective being a woman is an advantage not a disadvantage. Patronizing / demeaning comments from coworkers is just part of the industry you have to be tough or you will get run over. The advantage to being a woman is they can be verbally aggressive in meetings. If I do I am falling into the negative stereotype of men in the workplace and as a result it is not well received. If a woman does she is recognized and praised for being a strong independent woman.

&nbsp;

> The bottom line is that 90% of guys , especially in tech, aren't dating enough and are getting more desperate by the month...Most will settle for the first person that comes their way after a long dry spell. My matchmaking service is unmatched and provides a life-changing ratio for those that prove they are deserving. Porn and prostititues don't cut it or do a thing for your ego, life experiences, or to prevent BIG regrets later.

I really don't think I need to go through and attack the merit of these comments.
They are all cookie-cutter responses you typically see in articles such
as this one: the *"women are inferior via biology"* comment, which ignores all
current research in gender differences once social aspects are controlled (spoilers:
there aren't intellectual differences among genders. I've read extensively.); the
*"women are just whining"* responses designed to dismiss the concerns of somebody of whom
you cannot relate; and the *"women are just not likely to be as good as men,"* which
is related to the first archetype, but instead of misunderstanding biological controls,
it misunderstands basic statistics and makes leaps of inference using a standardized
value without controlling for socialization. Oh. And at least one comment dismissing
her as a *"man-hating lesbian,"* as though it were a synonym of feminist... depicting her
as somebody whose only meaning of existence is the intellectual destruction of a little less
than half the population. A rather odd accusation that she is somehow attempting to dismiss men.
It is also a disheartening illustration of sexuality as conveying morality. It makes me very sad.

All of these comments are rather biting and serve to demean or dismiss one's personal experiences.

I'll leave it to [Lindsey Bieda](http://rarlindseysmash.com/posts/2011-08-16-the-elephant-in-the-computer-lab)
to give evidence against the bulk of these arguments. However, the important
discussion to have here is how these comments paint a picture. The most important
takeaway must be this: when you speak about your experiences as
somebody under-represented in this culture, this is the type of "support" you can
expect. What **happened** to you... what *actually happened*
is immediately
invalidated by a very vocal, unrelenting hive-mind of unknown size. Consider how
one must feel to know that this is what awaits you if you dare to speak, with your
own voice, about your own experiences. Would you be quick to speak out? Could it be
possible that a fear of this response could suggest that these experiences are far more
widespread?

We need to change. We need codes of conduct that allow for paths of disclosure of
inappropriate behavior that are private and safe. We *also* need to allow people the
ability to
publicly exhibit their experiences and show their community bad behavior in the open.
We must allow it, and we must do everything we can to support those who do this. Men, women, people
of all genders: We need to counter this loud, brash, vocal minority with a supportive majority.

We can change. For what it is worth, and it may not be worth much for change is slow,
the comments here also paint a fear hidden within this mob mentality... a fear of
irrelevancy and a fear of the relinquishment of control. Essentially: a fear of change.
Let us see this as both optimism and opportunity. For their fear is as real as it is irrelevant;
this is progress in a morbid form.
